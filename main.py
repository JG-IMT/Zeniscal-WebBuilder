"""
Entry point of the website builder.

Usage:
    python main.py --websites-folder <folder> --build-websites
        Builds every website of the websites folder.
    python main.py --websites-folder <folder> --build-websites pamela connie
        Builds only the websites named.

A website is a sub-folder of the websites folder holding a website_settings.yml. Each version it declares is
cloned from git at its git_ref and built with Zensical. The website is assembled in <websites folder>/build/<path of its site_url>:
the latest version at its root, each earlier version in a folder named after it.
